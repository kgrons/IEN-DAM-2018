# IEN-DAM-2018

## FYI

The slides presented in this repo were **not presented** at the Insight Exchange Network's *Digital Assets & Content Leadership Exchange* in January 2018. The panel, titled "Assembling and Scaling the Team Your Content Stewardship Strategy Requires", was a conversation-style discussion chaired by Kevin Groome (Pica9) and featured myself, Dan Rosenberg (Associate Director, Asset Management at Time INC. Studios), and Jonathan Phillips (Senior Manager, Photography and Digital Asset Management at Marriott International).

Program and schedule information about the event can be found [here](https://www.insightxnetwork.com/digital-assets-content-leadership-exchange.html). 

I prepared these slides and discussed the topics addressed during the discussion.
